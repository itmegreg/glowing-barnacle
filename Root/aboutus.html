			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<h2>The beginning</h2>
			<p>
				Amanda Warren founded the Catnip Cafe when she needed a bit more room for her growing family of rescue kittens. We partner
				with local rescue centers to provide a warm, happy enviroment for cats-in-need until they find their forever home.
			</p>
			<h2>Come and  cuddle....</h2>
			<p>
				We've been prowling around this location for the past 5 years and our resident feline pals feel extra comfortable
				and cuddly here. Feel free to offer pets and head scratches, but please refrain from picking up the kitties as not all
				of them like that. If your lucky, though, your lap may prove to be the perfect napping location.
			</p>
			<h2>...or Take Home a Friend</h2>
			<p>
				We love all of the members of our furry family, but our end goal is to make sure that they find a new, loving home.
				Maybe you'll meet your next life-long companion on your next visit! Visit the adoption page to see some of the adoptoble cats.
			</p>
			<h2>Relax</h2>

				As for the ambiance...here's a taste:
